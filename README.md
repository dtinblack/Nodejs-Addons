Thanks

Many people helped me to develop a better understanding of writing a C++ wrapped Nodejs module, in particular:

* Manuel Kiessling's [The Node Beginner Book](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) gave me a good start to understanding Nodejs.
* The people who produced the documentation about [Nodejs Addons](http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) which included enough examples 
to get started.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) was a source of help and in particular the specific 
problems I had with creating a
[Nodejs Module](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15950345/npm-not-creating-node-modules-for-own-local-install-package) 
using NPM, and [passing arguments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16155235/passing-arguments-to-a-nodejs-module-using-a-c-wrapper) to 
a C++ wrapped module.
* The many examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/) gave me enough insight to solve some specific problems, however [Konstantin KÃ¤fer](https://github.com/kkaefer/node-cpp-modules.git) and [Nikhil Marathe's](https://github.com/nikhilm/jsfoo-pune-2012)
step-by-step approach was invaluable.
